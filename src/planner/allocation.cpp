The procedure Find Area To Share
tries to find for a given idle
robot an assigned area that it can help finish covering. If the path
from the given robotâ€™s location to the designated area is longer than
the number of unvisited cells in that area, then there is no point of
sending the robot there, since by the time the robot arrives there, its
coverage will have been completed. If an area that can be shared has
been found, its connected unvisited parts are defined as new areas and
added to the pool of unassigned areas instead of the original area. If
there is only one such part (e.g., its assigned robot has not started
covering it), then it is split into two balanced parts. Finally, both the
assigned robot and the idle robot are (re-)assigned to the sub-areas
with the safest paths from their current location.
